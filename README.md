# A Rust wrapper for the Linux DVB API

This library wraps the kernel interfaces directly, and currently doesn't try to do much more than be relatively thin but still safe wrapper for /dev/dvb devices.

The primary objectives for this library is to get frontend and demux devices working. CA support and DVB network support are secondary at the moment, but as the APIs seem relatively simple to wrap in a similar way than the frontend API, they probably can eventually be added too. There's no intention to support the deprecated video and audio device APIs. Deprecated parts of the API are left out from other parts too.

## Code generation

### Rust-bindgen

This library relies heavily on generated code. The lower FFI part (this library is pretty much an FFI wrapper, but I mean the lower level part of it here) is generated by rust-bindgen, and that part *is not* done as part of the build. First reason for this is that if bindgen had to run at every build, every machine building the code would have to have the required headers. They probably aren't that rare (on Debian they come from linux-libc-dev which isn't particularly esoteric package), but it's nicer to depend only on Rust stuff. The second reason is that at least on Debian, rust-bindgen doesn't work out of the box at the moment. Thirdly, the header doesn't seem to live all that much.

The bindgen codegen is implmented/documented as a bash script that does some nasty trickery under the codegen/bindgen directory.

### Higher level codegen

Under the codegen directory there's also properties subdirectory, that has a build script which generates a bunch of enums. Rust-bindgen generates only the bare necessities for FFI (and that's pretty much its job, not more), so the constants are combined into enums and helpers to convert them to the integer equivalents and back. Even though the raw generator code lines/generated code lines ratio is not very good, the generator code is mostly just lists of constant names that in some cases expand to several lists (the enum and match statements for the enum). I believe this approach has less tedious, repetitive coding and therefore less chances for causing subtle copy-paste-bugs.

# Documentation

Documentation is lacking at the moment, but as the library looks very much like the actual API it is meant to wrap, you can use the official documentation with this library too: http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/dvbapi.html
